Welcome to CPSC 1070 Chain Reaction!

The goal is to connect all of the nodes into a single connected group
by creating a series of chains between the nodes. The number of chains
coming off of an node must match the number on that node.

Enter the coordinates of the node you would like to connect and a direction.
If there is already a chain, a second chain will be added. If there are
already two chains, the chains will be removed.
